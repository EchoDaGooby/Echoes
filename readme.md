# Echoes, a WIP rhythm game
Echoes is still a work in progress project and **probably won't release**. but here's what it's all about:

It will be a 4 keys game (kinda like osu mania), it seems ***easy*** enough right??...

# Update as of 09/08/24 at 09:32 UTC

I'm starting to work on the game, since idk how to code a game my self, for now it will be on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), still work in progress tho..

For now i've got a playfield and keys layout (askl)

kinda shitty, but trust the process :3
